## 🗂️ Dataset
- **File:** `LS_2.0.csv`
- **Source:** Contains election-related features such as:
  - Candidate details
  - Party affiliation
  - Past election results
  - Demographic information
- **Preprocessing Steps:**
  - Missing value handling
  - Encoding categorical variables
  - Feature scaling
  - Train-test splitting

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Collection** – Load and inspect raw dataset (`LS_2.0.csv`).
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, encode categories, and normalize data.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Identify trends and patterns through visualizations.
4. **Model Selection & Training** – Implement and compare multiple ML models:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting
5. **Evaluation** – Use metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
6. **Forecasting** – Predict outcomes for new or unseen data.
